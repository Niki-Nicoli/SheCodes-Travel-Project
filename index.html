          <h4>WHY LISBON?</h4>
          <h2>Lisbon, the city of seven hills</h2>
          <p>
            The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, for
            its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon began
            its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills. However,
            it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey Nicolao
            d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete
            colinas' - the city of seven hills.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array
            of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
            selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with a
            variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills and
            see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops,
            the whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue sea.
